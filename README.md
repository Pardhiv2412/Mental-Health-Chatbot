# Mental-Health-Chatbot
Project Overview:
> This project involves the development of a mental health chatbot, fine-tuned using a custom dataset specifically curated to address various mental health queries and concerns. The goal is to provide users with a supportive and informative conversational agent that can help them navigate mental health challenges.

Features:
> Customized Responses: Tailored responses based on a dataset designed to address a wide range of mental health topics.
> Supportive Interactions: Engages users in a supportive and non-judgmental manner.
> Resource Recommendations: Provides users with relevant resources and coping strategies.

Development Process
The chatbot was developed using transfer learning techniques by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. The fine-tuning was performed on Google Colab utilizing a T4 GPU for accelerated training.

Constraints and Challenges
> Connectivity Issues: Frequent disconnections from Google Colab during training sessions posed significant challenges. Each disconnection often required restarting the training process, leading to increased development time and complexity.
> Resource Limitations: Limited computational resources and session time constraints on Google Colab necessitated careful management of training parameters and iterative tuning processes.
> Data Handling: Ensuring the dataset was comprehensive and representative of diverse mental health issues while maintaining data privacy and ethical standards.
